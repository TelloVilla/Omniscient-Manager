A new user can be created by hitting the "new user" button on the login screen and inputting a username and password

On the main screen there are buttons for logging out, a project viewer, and an add/edit button.
  On the left, a list view of activities and their dates are displayed for the user. When clicked, any notes the user has about an activity will be displayed on the
right side screen.
  Right clicking an actiity will allow the user to edit or remove an actiity from the list.

The project view button will take you to the project view, where an accordion list of projects with their included tasks and dates is shown. Select a Project, then open the next menu to select a task, then open the final menu to see your notes on said task. (NOTE: Buggy at the moment. A guide on how to get results will be given)
